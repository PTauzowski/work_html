						The series of Solid Mechanics Conferences have been organized by the Institute of Fundamental Technological Research since 1953. The conferences have maintained high scientific standard and served as a forum for exchange of ideas and research information. Traditionally a set of invited lectures have been presented at the Conferences by outstanding researchers. The aim of the Conference is to bring together the researchers from different countries and to create them the possibilities for the presentation of scientific results from a wide area of solid mechanics.
